# Inventory Management System

## Overview

The Inventory Management System is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage the inventory of a warehouse. It provides functionalities to add, update, and delete products, ensuring quick and reliable operations even with large inventories. This project demonstrates the use of appropriate data structures and algorithms to achieve efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Features

- **Add Products**: Easily add new products to the inventory with details such as product ID, name, quantity, and price.
- **Update Products**: Modify existing product details to reflect changes in inventory.
- **Delete Products**: Remove products from the inventory by their product ID.
- **Display Products**: View all products currently stored in the inventory.

## Data Structures

- **HashMap**: The `HashMap` data structure is used to store and manage the products, providing average O(1) time complexity for add, update, and delete operations.

## Classes

### Product
Represents a product in the inventory with attributes:
- `productId` (String): Unique identifier for the product.
- `productName` (String): Name of the product.
- `quantity` (int): Quantity of the product in stock.
- `price` (double): Price of the product.

### InventoryManagementSystem
Manages the inventory with the following methods:
- `addProduct(Product product)`: Adds a new product to the inventory.
- `updateProduct(Product product)`: Updates the details of an existing product.
- `deleteProduct(String productId)`: Deletes a product from the inventory by its ID.
- `displayProducts()`: Displays all products in the inventory.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/InventoryManagementSystem.git
   cd InventoryManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Compile and Run**:
   ```bash
   javac InventoryManagementSystem.java
   java InventoryManagementSystem
   ```

3. **Sample Operations**:
   - Adding products:
     ```java
     ims.addProduct(new Product("P001", "Laptop", 10, 999.99));
     ims.addProduct(new Product("P002", "Smartphone", 20, 599.99));
     ```
   - Updating a product:
     ```java
     ims.updateProduct(new Product("P001", "Laptop", 15, 949.99));
     ```
   - Deleting a product:
     ```java
     ims.deleteProduct("P002");
     ```
   - Displaying products:
     ```java
     ims.displayProducts();
     ```

## Time Complexity

- **Add Operation**: O(1) on average.
- **Update Operation**: O(1) on average.
- **Delete Operation**: O(1) on average.

## Optimization

- **Load Factor**: Managed to ensure efficient operations.
- **Concurrency**: Consider using `ConcurrentHashMap` for concurrent access.
- **Data Integrity**: Input validation and exception handling are implemented to maintain data integrity.
